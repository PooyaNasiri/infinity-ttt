# 🌌 Infinity Tic-Tac-Toe - Celestial Edition

![Project Preview](icon/banner_image.png)

Welcome to **Infinity Tic-Tac-Toe: Celestial Edition**. This isn't just a game; it's a strategic loop designed to eliminate the possibility of a draw. Built with a focus on high-end luxury aesthetics and fluid UX, this project reimagines a classic through the lens of modern digital art.

## 🚀 Live Demo

## ✨ Key Features

* **♾️ The Infinity Protocol**: A proprietary logic system where each player is limited to 3 pieces. Placing a 4th piece automatically clears the oldest one, ensuring a tie is mathematically impossible.
* **✨ Celestial Fade Effect**: Advanced visual feedback system. When a piece is scheduled to be removed, it enters a "Gasping" state—pulsing and blurring to warn the player.
* **🎨 Luxury Glassmorphism**: A deep Charcoal and Gold interface utilizing `backdrop-filter` and layered transparency for a premium holographic feel.
* **🌿 Organic Motion**: Built with custom cubic-bezier spring physics, every interaction feels tactile and fluid rather than mechanical.
* **📱 Responsive Architecture**: Fully adaptive design that maintains its "Stage" perspective across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **📊 Strategic HUD**: Real-time "Resource Dots" tracking player piece counts and turn-based stability meters.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

To run the Celestial Protocol locally:

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/PooyaNasiri/infinity-ttt.git](https://github.com/PooyaNasiri/infinity-ttt.git)
    cd infinity-ttt
    ```

2.  **Launch the Game**
    Since this project is built with vanilla technologies, you can simply open `index.html` in your browser.

    **Using a Local Server (Recommended for best performance):**
    ```bash
    # If you have Python installed
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
    Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🎮 How to Play

* **Objective**: Align 3 symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
* **The Twist**: You only have 3 "lives" (pieces).
* **The Warning**: On your turn, if you have 3 pieces on the board, your oldest piece will start to fade.
* **The Shift**: Placing your next piece will delete the fading one. Plan your moves two steps ahead!
